# Month-Calender-Project-

This project entails building a full-month calendar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calendar includes a header displaying the current month and date, all dates of the month from 1 to 30, and accurately reflects today's date. Everything is dynamically generated and automatically updates based on the current date and month. The calendar is visually appealing with effects like shadow and other design elements styled with CSS.
